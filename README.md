## Business Problem
**Office Mart** is a startup that sells a wide range of office products. For the first time to succeed in a competitive market, the company needs to leverage data analytics to understand and improve their sales performance. The key business problem revolves around how to use data effectively to make informed decisions.

## Key Challenges

### 1. Understanding Customer Preferences
- Identifying which products or product categories (e.g., smartphones, laptops, accessories) are performing well.
- Understanding the preferences of different customer segments (e.g., age groups, locations) to optimize product offerings and marketing strategies.

### 2. Sales Trend Analysis
- Analyzing sales trends over time to detect seasonality, popular sales periods, or factors driving sales growth or decline (e.g., promotions, holidays).
- Evaluating which promotional campaigns were most successful and why.

### 3. Inventory Management
- Using data to manage inventory levels more effectively by predicting demand, reducing overstock situations, or minimizing stockouts.
- Ensuring that fast-moving items are always in stock and identifying slow-moving products that could tie up capital.

### 4. Pricing Strategy
- Determining the optimal pricing strategy based on market trends and competitor pricing.
- Analyzing customer response to pricing changes and promotions to ensure the best balance between profitability and competitiveness.

### 5. Customer Retention and Acquisition
- Using data to understand customer behavior, such as repeat purchases, average order value, and time between purchases.
- Developing loyalty programs or marketing campaigns based on customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis to improve retention rates.
- Identifying new customer acquisition channels through analysis of sales and marketing data.

### 6. Sales Channel Performance
- Assessing the performance of different sales channels (e.g., online store, retail outlets) and optimizing the allocation of resources to the most profitable channels.

## How Data Analytics Can Help

Office Mart can use data analytics in several ways to address the above challenges:

- **Descriptive Analytics:** Understand what has happened by reviewing historical sales data, customer behavior, and product performance. This helps in identifying key trends and patterns.
  
- **Predictive Analytics:** Anticipate future sales and customer preferences using techniques such as forecasting and predictive modeling. This will help Electronics Hub in demand forecasting, inventory planning, and marketing efforts.
  
- **Prescriptive Analytics:** Provide recommendations for the best course of action based on data insights. For example, recommending optimal pricing, ideal inventory levels, or suggesting the best timing for promotions.

### 4. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Forecast sales trends, predict customer behavior (churn, repeat purchases), and perform price sensitivity analysis using machine learning models.

### 5. **Prescriptive Analytics**
   - Recommend optimal inventory levels, pricing strategies, and marketing actions based on predictive insights.

### 6. **Implementation**
